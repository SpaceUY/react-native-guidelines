# Environment Setup

Hey team! Getting our React Native app up and running with Expo is a breeze. Here’s a quick guide to help you set everything up. We'll keep it light and link you to the detailed docs where needed.

## Steps

### 1. Install Node.js

First things first, we need Node.js. It's like the engine that runs our app. Head over to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and grab the latest LTS version.

### 2. Create a New Expo Project

With Node installed and ready to go, let’s start a new project. Run:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

Pick a template you like and you're all set! If you need more info, the [Expo project setup guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) has you covered.

### 3. Run the app

Once the project has been created just go to the project folder and run:

```bash
expo start
```

### 4. Connect a Device

To see your app live, scan the QR code generated by Expo CLI with the Expo Go app (available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&pli=1)) or connect your emulator. If you want to run the app without Expo Go or you want to know more about how to run the app on a device, here’s the [Expo Go guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/).
