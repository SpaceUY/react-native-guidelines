# Data handling

Axios is utilized as the HTTP client for making network requests in React Native. Fetch API provided by the browser is powerful but lacks features like interceptors, request cancellation, and automatic JSON parsing. Axios, with its intuitive API, support for Promise-based requests, and features such as interceptors and automatic JSON parsing, offers a robust solution for handling data fetching and communication with backend services.
