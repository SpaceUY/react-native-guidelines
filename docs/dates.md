# Handling Dates

There are several libraries available to streamline date manipulation and formatting. To maintain consistency with our web guidelines, we recommend using **Date-fns**.

**Date-fns** is a modern JavaScript date utility library that provides a wide range of functions to handle date manipulation, parsing, formatting, and more. It is known for its simplicity and modularity, allowing you to import only the functions you need, which helps to keep your bundle size small. Additionally, **Date-fns** has a consistent API and extensive documentation, making it easy to use and integrate into your projects.

### Why Use Date-fns?

- **Lightweight:** Date-fns is modular, allowing you to import only the specific functions you need, reducing the overall bundle size.
- **Immutable & Pure Functions:** Date-fns functions are immutable and pure, meaning they don't modify the input date objects but return new ones, ensuring safer and more predictable code.
- **Comprehensive Functionality:** From formatting and parsing dates to comparing and manipulating them, Date-fns covers a wide range of date-related operations.
- **Consistency:** Using Date-fns across projects helps maintain consistency in how dates are handled and formatted, aligning with our web guidelines.
- **Timezone Support:** Date-fns offers support for timezones through an additional package, making it versatile for global applications.
